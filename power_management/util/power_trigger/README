Support for triggering power logging using a parallel I/O port
--------------------------------------------------------------

This library & executable provide the ability to programmatically trigger
logging using a parallel I/O interface.

Implementation: // TODO is this correct?
The low-level details are included in the library.  Triggering happens using
the interface's data lines -- the library pulls all data pins high, leaves them
high for ? microseconds, then pulls them low again.

// TODO power_trigger binary.  Is it a daemon, or does it need to just pull the
// line high for a millisecond?

Usage
-----

Physical:
Developed for use with the NI DAQmx.  Attach a line from one of the data pins
to the digital trigger channel being monitored by the DAQmx/data acquisition
software.

TODO
----
1. Does line need to be kept high to enable logging?
	- If so, need to convert binary into
