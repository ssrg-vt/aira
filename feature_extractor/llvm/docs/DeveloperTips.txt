Tips to tweak the feature extractor
-----------------------------------

Below are tips and how-to's for changing/adding to the feature extractor.

-----------------
Adding an IR Pass
-----------------

The IR pass is implemented as a subclass of the FunctionPass class, i.e. it
iterates through each function in the code.  IR features are implemented as
subclasses of the IRFeature class, which act as counters.  Each registered
feature is handed each IR instruction encountered by the pass, which allows each
individual feature to accumulate statistics from each IR instruction.  Each IR
feature must implement the following calls:

	clear - reset the statistics about the feature to the default values, readying
          it for another function

	collect - collect features about the specified IR instruction

	print - print statistics about the collected feature to the passed output
          stream

To register a new feature with the pass, edit the FunctionIRFeatures
constructor to add a new feature to the list of features:

	features.push_back(new <new feature>);

Adding other directories to be built by autoconf
------------------------------------------------

- To add a top-level directory to the build process, edit "configure".  Add the
  command to configure the directory:

  ac_config_commands="$ac_config_commands <new directory>"

  You may want to place this near where the other instantiations of this command
  are placed, e.g.:

  ac_config_commands="$ac_config_commands Makefile"
  ac_config_commands="$ac_config_commands <new directory>"


- To add a directory inside of a folder that is already being built by
  autoconf, edit the Makefile in that directory so that the "DIRS" variable
  includes your directory, e.g.:

  DIRS=<new directory>
