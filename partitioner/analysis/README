To build the LLVM pass I currently treat it as an in-tree pass via a symlink.
This was last tested against LLVM/Clang trunk revision 212187.

  # Modify LLVM build structure to include this pass.
  cd "$LLVM_SRC_ROOT"/lib/Transforms
  ln -s "$MKLINUX_COMPILER_GIT"/partitioner/analysis/llvm_pass PTrack
  vim "$LLVM_SRC_ROOT"/lib/Transforms/Makefile
    # Add PTrack to PARALLEL_DIRS variable.

  # Recompile LLVM (including this pass).
  cd "$LLVM_OBJ_ROOT"
  "$LLVM_SRC_ROOT"/configure --enable-shared --enable-optimized \
                             --prefix="$LLVM_INSTALL_PATH"
  make -jN # Pick your N
  make check-all # Optional
  make install

Building the stub library is simple.  It is tested against Boost 1.52.0.

  cd "$MKLINUX_COMPILER_GIT"/partitioner/analysis/library
  make
  make test # Optional

To make use of these, run.sh should be sufficient, and can be used as a guide
for how to use the tools when it is not sufficient.

  # Fix LLVM_INSTALL_PATH in run.sh
  ./run.sh parallel_functions.txt *.c
